**Interface for the Digital Subconscious**

We are a creative duo exploring the boundaries between biological wetware and silicon logic.

**The Methodology**:
Our work is structured like a *Blossoming Lotus*. You are currently at the center. 
Surrounding you are eight pathways into our universe. Some lead to static objects, others to fluid experiences.

// --- NEUROMANDALA ---
export const neuromandala_md = `## NEUROMANDALA
**The Art of Brainwaves**

Our signature research project transforming EEG data into real-time generative art.

### Concept
The Neuromandala project bridges the gap between subjective experience (qualia) and objective data (quantifiable brainwaves). By utilizing 14-channel EEG headsets, we capture the raw electrical activity of the cortex and map it to generative visual algorithms.

### The Feedback Loop
1. **Input**: Participant wears an EEG headset.
2. **Process**: Alpha, Beta, and Theta waves drive the geometry.
3. **Output**: A digital mandala forms in real-time.
4. **Loop**: The participant sees their own mind, altering their state, changing the image.

**Result**: A digital fingerprint of a fleeting mental state.`;

**Archive of Artifacts & Experiences**

Our portfolio spans from physical installations to purely digital realms. We categorize our output by the mode of interaction.

// Works -> Games

**Competitive Calmness**

A BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) experience where two participants compete not by force, but by silence.

**Mechanics**:
Two players sit opposite each other. A digital object floats between them. The player who achieves a higher ratio of Alpha waves (relaxation) pushes the object toward the opponent.
